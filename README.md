## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Zomato Dataset & Black Friday Sales Dataset

This project showcases my skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by diving into two distinct datasets: Zomato and Black Friday Sales. The aim of this project is to extract insights, identify trends, and understand the underlying patterns in the data through visualizations and statistical analysis.

Key Features:
Zomato Dataset: Analysis of restaurant data, including ratings, cost, location, cuisines, and more to uncover insights about customer preferences, popular cuisines, and factors influencing restaurant success.
Black Friday Sales Dataset: Examination of customer purchasing patterns during the Black Friday sale, identifying key demographic groups, popular product categories, and purchasing behaviors.
Techniques & Tools Used:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Descriptive Statistics
Data Visualization (using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Feature Analysis & Correlation Study
Insights & Recommendation Generation
Key Findings:
Zomato Dataset: Patterns between restaurant ratings and cost, popular cuisines in different locations, and the impact of certain factors like location on restaurant performance.
Black Friday Sales Dataset: Identification of top customer segments, analysis of high-revenue product categories, and insights into the purchasing habits during sales events.
Tech Stack:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
